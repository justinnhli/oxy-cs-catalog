# Computer Science Program

## Overview

Computers have transformed our world technologically, economically, and socially. Although computer science has its roots in mathematics, the use of computers increasingly informs almost every academic discipline. At Occidental College, the study of Computer Science emphasizes an understanding not only of the process of computing but also of the promise and limitations of computers within an intellectual, societal, and ethical framework. A major or minor in Computer Science can help prepare students for a variety of opportunities for subsequent employment or graduate work. Moreover, the program can provide students with models of problem solving and theoretical constructs that can shed light on human intelligence and the workings of the mind.

Students must have completed COMP 131 before they declare the major, and are strongly encouraged to have also taken COMP 149 and COMP 229. Students considering the Mathematics or CS+X concentration should begin meeting with an advisor early on. Students in the CS+X concentration should submit a proposal using this webform to the Department Chair for approval prior to the beginning of their Junior year.

## Major Requirements

Computer science is a broad field, encompassing topics from digital logic and advanced mathematical theory to video games and data science. At the same time, these foundations and applications require fundamental knowledge of how a computer works, as well as the ability to translate processes into working programs. The Computer Science major coursework mirrors this structure. A student majoring in Computer Science must take a minimum of 12 courses (48 units).

</table>

### Concentrations

Students should meet with an advisor early on to explore potential pathways through the major. Students will select one of the following three concentrations:

#### Computational Mathematics Concentration

Six elective courses at 200-level or above, with at most two courses at the 200-level (not including Linear Algebra or Discrete Mathematics). Students must complete three elective courses from MATH and three elective courses from COMP that are centered on a theme in computational mathematics, plus a senior comprehensive project related to the theme. At most two of these courses can be double-counted for another major/minor.

This pathway reflects the growing importance of work in computer science that is grounded in mathematical foundations, and work in mathematics that requires an understanding of computational methods and implementation. Students who are interested in the Computational Mathematics option will work with an advisor to propose an interdisciplinary concentration of six courses on a related theme. Students may choose to seek an additional advisor from the Mathematics Department, but this is not required. Proposals must include an intellectual rationale for the course selection and associated senior project. The proposal should be submitted to the department using this form no later than two semesters prior to the semester of graduation, and at least two weeks before Advising Week.

Any changes to the pathway must be approved via a Petition for Special Consideration, signed by the academic advisor, the department chair, and the outside advisor for the CS+X theme, and submitted to the Registrar's Office no later than the week prior to registration in the semester before graduation.

<table>
<tr>  <td>MATH 210</td>  <td>Discrete Mathematics</td>  <td>4 units</td>  </tr>
<tr>  <td>MATH 214</td>  <td>Linear Algebra</td>        <td>4 units</td>  </tr>
</table>

#### Computer Science Concentration

Six courses 200-level or above in at least two different sub-fields of computer science (artificial intelligence, interfaces, security, systems/software, and/or theory). At least three of those courses must be at the 300-level. COMP 317 is highly recommended for students interested in graduate school. Students can count at most two courses from the Additional Electives (below) towards the major in this pathway.

This pathway is designed to give students broad working knowledge of the many facets of the field, while maintaining freedom to pursue specific topics in depth.

#### CS+X Concentration

Six courses 200-level or above, with at least three of those courses at the 300-level. Students must complete two CS courses in different sub-fields, a four-course interdisciplinary concentration around a computer science or technology theme (for a total of 24 units), plus a senior comprehensive project related to the theme. At least three of the four courses in the interdisciplinary concentration must be outside of and not cross-listed with Computer Science, and at most two of these courses can be double-counted for another major/minor.

This pathway reflects the growing importance of computer science in many fields, and allows students to explore the intersection of technology with their other academic interests. Students who are interested in the CS+X option will work with an advisor to propose the interdisciplinary concentration of four courses on a related theme. Proposals must include an intellectual rationale for the course selection. A faculty member outside of Computer Science must approve the proposal and agree to act as an outside advisor for the senior comprehensive project. The proposal should be submitted to the department using this form no later than two semesters prior to the semester of graduation, and at least two weeks before Advising Week.

Any changes to the pathway must be approved via a Petition for Special Consideration, signed by the academic advisor, the department chair, and the outside advisor for the CS+X theme, and submitted to the Registrar's Office no later than the week prior to registration in the semester before graduation.

### Second-Stage Writing Requirement

Students majoring in Computer Science will satisfy the college's Second-Stage Writing Requirement by receiving at least a C in COMP 390, typically offered in spring, and satisfactorily completing its writing component. The writing requirement must be completed by May of the student's junior year; students considering study abroad must coordinate with the department early to ensure that they can fulfill the writing requirement. We recommend that students do not study abroad in the spring of their junior year or the fall of their senior year.

In order to graduate, students who fail to fulfill the writing requirement by the deadline will be required to (1) take a composition course in the Writing & Rhetoric Department, approved by the Computer Science department chair and the Director of Writing Programs; and (2) include and complete a written component in their senior comprehensive that meets the approval of the Computer Science faculty.

### Comprehensive Requirement

In the senior year, the student will complete a project on a topic in Computer Science. The project is coordinated with the work of the Computer Science Senior Seminar (COMP 490). All majors take the Senior Seminar in the fall semester of the senior year. Students considering study abroad must coordinate with the department to ensure the completion of their senior comprehensive project, but we recommend not studying abroad during fall of senior year.

To earn credit for COMP 490, students will present their completed project to the computer science faculty at a public showcase open to the campus community, in addition completing a thesis on their work. Example projects include a fully functional and user-tested mobile app, a research paper in computer science, or a review of technology policies and their impacts. Students who pursue the CS+X pathway must complete a comprehensive project related to their theme. Distinction will be awarded by the Computer Science faculty (and in consultation with external faculty for students pursuing CS+X) to exceptionally strong comprehensive projects.

### College Honors

Honors in Computer Science may be awarded to graduating seniors who demonstrate excellence in their coursework and perform additional research related to their senior comprehensive project during the spring semester of their senior year. Intent to propose an honors project is due the first Friday of December by completing the form linked here. Decision to accept or reject the proposal will be communicated to the student before the first day of classes in the spring semester. Students will be required to enroll in COMP 499 in order to be eligible for Honors. Honors will be awarded based on evaluation of the honors project produced in COMP 499 by Computer Science faculty. To be eligible, students must have a 3.5 grade point average in the major and a 3.25 overall grade point average.

## Minor Requirements

Students seeking a Computer Science Minor must complete six courses (24 credits) which satisfy the following:

* Two courses are required: COMP 131 and COMP 229.
* At least four (16 credits) of the six courses (24 credits)  in the Minor must be COMP courses at the 200-level or higher.
* One of the following two choices is also required to fulfill the mathematics component of the Minor: COMP 149 or both MATH 210 and MATH 214.

## Transfer Credit Policies

Students who earned a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Statistics examination will earn four units of credit and will be considered to have completed the equivalent of COMP 146.

The Computer Science Department policy on transfer credit conforms to College policy. Students should reference the Transfer Credit section for details. Online courses are allowed for transfer credit. A score of 4 or 5 on the AP Computer Science examination is equivalent to COMP 131, and places a student into COMP 229 (Data Structures).

For students who have taken the AP Computer Science Principles examination, who have taken IB or A-Level examinations in Computer Science, who have transfer credit, or are in similar situations, the department will evaluate each student's situation individually. To aid in the evaluation, students should complete the guided placement programming assignment found at <https://www.oxy.edu/academics/areas-study/computer-science/self-guided-assessment-quiz>. A typical student should be able to complete the assignment in under two hours. In general, to place out of COMP 131, a student should be proficient in variables, branches (if, else), loops (for, while), functions (parameters, scope, return versus print), and object-oriented programming (classes versus instances, constructors, passing familiarity with inheritance). All other students should begin with COMP 131 as soon as possible.

Students receiving a 4 or 5 on the AP Statistics Examination are exempt from COMP 146; MATH 150 is recommended for these students wanting to take further statistics courses.

# COURSES

## COMP 101: Justice and Equity in Technology

Throughout their careers, students in Computer Science will have the opportunity to affect society through the technologies that they create. Yet technology is not created in a vacuum, but rather is a product of the ingrained assumptions of its creators, and the societies that structure these assumptions. When working with the tools of Computer Science, students will face traces of the field's racist, sexist, homophobic, and imperialist history, and will have to decide how to work with or challenge these parts of the field. This course prepares students to work for justice and equity in technology and society by facilitating conversations about the sometimes-oppressive history and impact of Computer Science, and by uplifting voices that have historically been marginalized within the field. By the end of the course, students will be able to analyze and discuss technology within its broader context, and be able to use the tools of Computer Science to subvert the unjust structures the field has inherited.

## COMP 113: Data Science

This course is a computational introduction to data science. Students will use R to clean data, create models (regressions, clustering), and visualize and communicate the results. The course will include descriptive statistics and methods of hypothesis testing as students learn how to make arguments from data.

## COMP 131: Fundamentals of Computer Science

Computer Science is about the organization of information and the design of processes that use it. This course teaches students to think computationally - how to break down processes into components that can then be fully described - and to acquire other habits necessary for a computer scientist. Students should come out of the course able to write simple, but complete, programs of their choosing, and should also be able to diagnose problems in unfamiliar programs.

## COMP 146: Statistics

Comprehensive study of measures of central tendency, variation, probability, the normal distribution, sampling, estimation, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. Introduction to use of technology in statistics. Real-life problems are used to illustrate methods. Weekly lab. Not open to students who have completed or are currently enrolled in PSYC 201, BIO 368, MATH 150, or any Mathematics course above 200.

In this course, students will gain additional experience in object-oriented programming in Java. Students will work in pairs and small groups on multiple programming projects. Topics will include test-driven development, debugging, and source code management, but focus will be on writing maintainable and efficient code. This course is intended to prepare students with some programming experience (COMP 131 or equivalent) for more advanced programming courses.

Prerequisites: COMP 131 or equivalent, or by instructor permission

## COMP 197: Independent Study

Directed individual study. Permission of instructor and department chair required. Graded on a Credit/No Credit basis only.

## COMP 229: Data Structures

We begin with topics found in advanced programming. In particular, topics from object-oriented programming and how this differs from procedural programming. We then move on to the study of dynamic data structures, such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, graphs, hash tables, sets and more. Completion of this course opens up the remainder of the Computer Science classes and is required for minors. Common themes that run throughout this course are: (1) implementation of the abstract data types, and (2) spatial and memory consideration and analysis.

Prerequisites: COMP 127, COMP 131, COMP 211, a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Computer Science A examination, or permission of instructor

## COMP 230: Pollinator Drones, Wish Factories, and Robotic Dogs: 'What-if' Scenarios as Drivers of Creative Production and Imagination

As humankind stares down a number of unprecedented global challenges, the need for creative, radical thinking is imperative. In this interdisciplinary studio, students will develop a series of detailed and speculative projects inspired by boundary-pushing artistic and technological practices. The course will examine precedents from contemporary art, media, engineering, performance, design, and technology that offer responses to a wide range of "what-if" scenarios. The primary goal of the class will be to guide students as they develop a methodology for making creative and responsive work - one that relies on provocation and imagination as driving forces. Class projects will be designed to develop critical thinking and research skills, art-making and visual communication capabilities, and will call for speculative, even fantastical, responses to complex sites and situations. Technological and data-driven approaches, including data analysis, modeling, and scenario planning, will be integrated into the class assignments, encouraging cross-disciplinary collaborations between computer science and media arts students. Instructional assignments will explore a range of materials, scales, and research methods, and will encourage students to develop their abilities to hone and express innovative responses to complex societal and relational questions. The final series of class projects will address the uncertainty of climate change as a contextual framework, and final proposals may range from site-specific art installations to new applications for robotics; from creating futuristic soundscapes to designing experiences in VR. Site visits and guest lecturers will extend students' connections with selected Los Angeles sites and their contexts, the understanding of a broad set of perspectives and values, and real-world examples of collaborative, cross-disciplinary projects. Not open to First Year Students. Permission of instructor required.

## COMP 239: Computer Organization

This course covers the basics of how a computer works, focusing especially on the hardware-software interface. Students will learn about the limitations of the physical computer, and that it may not be possible to ignore the lower-level hardware when designing efficient software. Students will learn to implement programs in Assembly language and C/C++. They will investigate the main components of the computer and it's processor and master the binary language of computers. They will learn important design concepts such as memory hierarchy and parallel computing, and have a brief encounter with principles of digital logic. This is a required course for the Computer Science major. Includes one 1.5-hour lab period per week.

Prerequisites: COMP 131

## COMP 242: Music and Artificial Intelligence

This course focuses on programming for music and sound with artificial intelligence tools and methods. Special attention will be given to systems that are able to co-create music and enhance creative workflows. Students will learn the basics of machine improvisation and introductory elements of machine learning to apply the best methods in system design, and to acquire the skills that meet the new needs and standards of the creative industries. Max/MSP/Jitter is a programming environment conceived to be accessible to students with no familiarity with computer programming; programs are realized by drawing patch cables with the mouse to connect objects that are visually represented on screen. This approach will provide students with a gentle learning curve to prototype development. Exploration through composition, improvisation and performance that integrate sensor technology, multimedia and data analysis will be fostered through working in constant dialogue with other disciplines.</p>

Sub-field: INTERFACES

## COMP 271: Haptic Media

"Haptic" is a word that describes the sense of touch, derived from a Greek root meaning to grasp, perceive, or fasten, and it has been used to describe technologies and aesthetics that communicate, or mediate, this tactile sense. We often think of touch as doing things with our hands, but touch actually affects all parts of the body, and plays a role in smell (particles entering the nose), sound (as vibration or a wave), taste (of the tongue touching), and even vision (through synesthesia or haptic visuality). However, in the current age of social distancing, many of us are feeling "touch starved," and looking to digital media as a source of intimacy and community. How can we learn in this moment from haptic technologies, haptic aesthetics, and uses of these in video games, virtual reality, digital-physical art installations, and even early moving pictures? How can we communicate felt experiences as forms of unique knowledge? Drawing from video game studies, humor and gimmicks, feminist film theory, and Black feminist thought, this course takes an interdisciplinary approach to questions of haptic media. Students will complete and give feedback on six short solo haptic pieces and one final collaborative project. The final aim of the course is an exhibition of student work accessible as a web-based virtual exhibition.

## COMP 277: Game Design

Video games are one of the newest forms of media, and offer tremendous promise for both entertainment, storytelling, and education. Starting from the text-based adventures of the 1970s to the billion-dollar industry today, students will learn how to use psychology and game mechanics to create compelling narratives, as well as gaining a glimpse into large-scale software development.

Prerequisites: COMP 131

## COMP 295: Computing in Real Life Internship

Students will work with LA-based non-profits such as STEAM:CODERS, a Pasadena-based organization that teaches local middle and high school students to program, or the Association for Women in Mathematics, a national organization that promotes women in computation. Students will complete weekly reflection papers and a final presentation describing what they've learned about computation IRL.

## COMP 357: Networking

Much of the power of computers is that they are not individual machines, but units on a network that can exchange information. This course starts with the transmitting binary electrical signals, then builds up to the TCP/IP stack and the algorithms involved, and finally current research questions in the field.

Sub-field: SYSTEMS

Prerequisites: COMP 229 and COMP 239, or permission of instructor

## COMP 367: Practicum in Computer Science

The largest programming projects are completed by multiple computer scientists working together. Clients across Eagle Rock and the Oxy community will propose problems with computational solutions, which we will complete in teams as a semester long-project. Using standard tools, such as version control, we will apply the principles of user-centered design to software: understanding the needs of the client, developing software, and testing the product with the user, before repeating the cycle.

Sub-field: SYSTEMS

Prerequisites: COMP 127 or COMP 131

## COMP 373: Databases

Any large amount of data, such as that stored by Google or Facebook, requires specialized algorithms to ensure consistency and efficient access. From relational models and SQL to newer graph databases, students will understand how to represent entities a domain with rows in a database, culminating in a project that uses this knowledge in a real-world setting.

Sub-field: SYSTEMS

Prerequisites: COMP 229 and COMP 239, or permission of instructor

## COMP 379: Operating Systems

An operating system ties together the hardware and software components of a computer. For interested students, this will likely be the final step to completely understanding what happens when code is executed. Topics include virtual memory, file systems, process management, parallel computing, and others.

Sub-field: SYSTEMS

Prerequisites: COMP 229 and COMP 239, or permission of instructor

## COMP 383: Computer Security

The security of computer systems is a topic relevant at both the personal and the national levels. This course introduces students to the subject of computer security, teaching them the techniques an adversary might use to compromise a computer system, and what safeguards exist to prevent such unauthorized access.

Sub-field: SECURITY

Prerequisites: COMP 229 and COMP 239

## COMP 389: Cryptography

Security on the internet is fundamentally based on the mathematical properties of the algorithms we use to encrypt our data. This course teaches students the theory behind these algorithms and how future advances such as quantum computing may affect current standards of security and privacy. Topics include ciphers and frequency analysis, private and public key cryptography, randomness, and quantum cryptography.

Sub-field: SECURITY

Prerequisites: COMP 149

## COMP 390: Computer Science Junior Seminar

This course focuses on responsible conduct of Computer Science. Students will explore the effects of technology on the modern world, including issues of electronic voting, personal security and privacy, intellectual property, and others. This course will culminate in a research paper on one of these topics, examining the technical background, as well as the social forces that contextualize the issue. Students should have a decent understanding of the challenges of writing software, and why certain questions are computationally difficult (that is, require significant time/memory).

Prerequisites: COMP 229 and one 300-level COMP course

## COMP 395: Topics in Computer Science

Topics vary semester to semester.

Prerequisites: COMP 127, COMP 131, COMP 211, or COMP 229

## COMP 397: Independent Study
